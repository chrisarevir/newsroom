What's up twitch? It's ya boy DS Streams and I am *super* excited for what we have in store today

That's right, we're doing speedruns! **airhorn**

For those new to the channel, a speedrun is when we attempt to accomplish a task in as little time as possible

Today we're doing 2 speed runs! As you know it's fun fact friday, so we gotta do some fun facts

We'll be doing a 3 fact speed run today

As always, once we open up wikipedia and hit "random article" it's off to the races

3, 2, 1 start!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fact 1
link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Cap_Trafalgar

During WW1 ocean liners (long distance oceanic passenger ships) were converted to military vessels.
One german boat, SS Cap Trafalgar was disguised as a British ship, RMS Carmania, and tasked with disrupting British
merchant supply lines. Upon leaving port, the first vessel it encountered was the real RMS Carmania, another
converted ocean liner, which promptly sunk the fake Carmine.

Fact 2
link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the only among the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World (as told by the Greeks)
that has no known location. It is either:
- Entirely a myth
- Was destroyed sometime in the first century BC
- (Most likely) not in _Babylon_ but another "Babylon" which means "Gate of the Gods" and is actually in Nineveh
    - However the ruins are in an area of syria under frequent military occupation so they cannot be explored currently

Fact 3
link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brink%27s-Mat_robbery

6 men rob security company Brinks-mat holdings in Heathrow airport with help from insider.
One of the thieves bought a house with cash from the robbery and 2 guard dogs, named Brinks and Mat.
Much of the 3 tons of gold has never been recovered, but some details of its fencing were reported in
the Panama Papers from 2016

*screams* oh hell yeah, a new record! *pops off of chair*

While I'm basking in the hype, let's roll a quick message from today's sponsor the DSPCA

*sniffles* gets me every time, such a great cause

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up we have our standup speedrun, let's see if we can keep the personal best streak up.

...

That wasn't our best, definitely got slowed down a bit during the classic Lily section. Getting through
Christian Corner was a lot faster than expected though, so at least we're improving some.

And that pretty much concludes our stream! Once again, thank you to today's sponsor The DSPCA for their
touching ad. As always, please remember to like comment and subscribe to my socials; you can find me on
Twitch (duh), youtube, twitter, and OnlySpans under my handle @DS_Streams. Thanks and as always, Go Streams
