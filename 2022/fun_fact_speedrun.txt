converted ocean liner, which promptly sunk the fake Carmine.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the only among the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World (as told by the Greeks)
that has no known location. It is either:

- Was destroyed sometime in the first century BC
- (Most likely) not in _Babylon_ but another "Babylon" which means "Gate of the Gods" and is actually in Nineveh
    - However the ruins are in an area of syria under frequent military occupation so they cannot be explored currently
