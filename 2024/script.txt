T: Good morning, I’m Troy

C: I’m Christian

T & C: and this is UIF News

C: Well Troy, it’s April 1st and you know what that means?

T: It’s Q2

C: Yes that’s right, it’s Q2 2024, even though I’m pretty sure yesterday was January 2023

T: Time flies when you’re having Helix

C: It sure does, but speaking of 2023 that brings us to our top story.

C: In what may feel like a scene straight out of classic 1993 film Groundhog Day, the UIF roadmap for 2024 is looking 
alarmingly similar to the initial proposal for the 2023 roadmap.
C: There have been a “growth” of concerns around the similarity, leaving some “division” among UIF members. 
C: Some are questioning if this was a foreseeable and preventable outcome, while Friedrich Nietzsche maintains 
that time is a flat circle and we are doomed to endlessly repeat our actions
T: [Off-camera] Nietzsche? Who let him on the team?
C: In any case, sources close to the matter claim the 2024 roadmap has been named "Copy of 2023_roadmap final final",
indicating that this is in fact no longer open to revisions.

C: In other UIF news it will come as no surprise to veterans of the team that UIF is once again in consideration for owning
absolutely anything remotely related to Frontend
C: Recent examples include gaining ownership of the Header, Footer, Armer, Kneer, and a pending request for the Body.
A system of systems approach is being proposed to introduce a new system, the Nervous System, which will be used for messaging
as well as Reacting


T: This will make Helix truly the backbone of the company. Next up we'll hear from our man in the field [Jeremy or alt moniker], who
has been [intro to topic]. It's all yours [Jeremy or alt moniker]

-- Jeremy Segment --

T: Truly astounding, thank you [Jeremy or alt moniker] for your intrepid reporting as always.

C: It's now time for the weather, from our wonderful weatherwoman (or was it weatherful wonderwoman?) [Robbin or alt moniker]

-- Robbin weather --

C: Thank you for the report, [some kind of tie-in joke]

T: And now a few words from our sponsors

-- Used Component Salesman ad --

T: Hello and welcome back. 
T: A new member of the i18n team reported for standup from Paris France this week, an all too common blunder when a newhire
is asked to validate a french locale. Despite all of the delicious croissants and baguettes, or perhaps due to them, the
team member considers the trip a pain -- [baguette bg image]

T: The i18n team has recently released Get To Know 3 aka GTK 3. This exciting program will teach users all about the third
number. [bg image Sesame Street Count w/ 3] This release provides key functionality to complete our High Integrity Commitment
to HBO for the construction of Sesame Street

C: We have reports of a story breaking abroad, we are now going live with our Foreign Corrospondent, [Nick or alt moniker]

-- Nick Segment --


T: Thank you Nick. Legendary television and movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer has expressed interest in Helix. Bruckheimer is rebooting his
classic series Pirates of the Carribean, and felt the Dock would be a perfect fit. In an interview, Bruckheimer said he loved
the Dock, calling it "iconic" --  ah correction he said it contained icons. It is unclear if Johnny Depp, who played Captain Jack Sparrow
in the previous films is attached to the project, but our sources say the Sidepanel is.


T: And now for our final segment, we have [Brock or alt moniker]

-- Brock office --

T: And that was Procorelitzer prize winning journalist, Brock Noah.
