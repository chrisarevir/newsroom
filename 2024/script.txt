T & C: and this is UIF News

C: Well Troy, it’s April 1st and you know what that means?

T: It’s Q2

C: Yes that’s right, it’s Q2 2024, even though I’m pretty sure yesterday was January 15th 2023

C: In what may feel like a scene straight out of classic 1993 film Groundhog Day, the UIF roadmap for 2024 is looking 
alarmingly similar to the initial proposal for the 2023 roadmap.
C: There have been a “growth” of concerns around the similarity, leaving some “division” among UIF members. 
C: Some are questioning if this was a foreseeable and preventable outcome, while Friedrich Nietzsche maintains 
that time is a flat circle and we are doomed to endlessly repeat our actions
T: [Off-camera] Nietzsche? Who let him on the team?
C: Shut up Troy, this is my piece // can workshop interjection
C: In any case, sources close to the matter claim the 2024 roadmap has been named "Copy of 2023_roadmap final final",
indicating that this is in fact no longer open to revisions.

C: In other UIF news it will come as no surprise to veterans of the team that UIF is once again in consideration for owning
absolutely anything remotely related to Frontend
C: Recent examples include gaining ownership of the Header, Footer, Armer, Kneer, and a pending request for the Body.
A system of systems approach is being proposed to introduce a new system, the Nervous System, which will be used for messaging
as well as Reacting
